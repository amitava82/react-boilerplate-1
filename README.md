# Memory game

```
npm install
npm run start
```

#### Note
Very basic memory game built with React. I'd build this with Redux store instead of component state and redux-saga for side effects.
Using Firebase for Zero server dependency with realtime score update. There is no security rule so anyone can update score with same name.
